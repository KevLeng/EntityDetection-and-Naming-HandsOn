# Lab 3: Create Management Zones - Separate your environment into Production and Staging

A management zone filter can be applied to only view Production or Staging Applications, Services, Processes, or Hosts.

A management zone consists of multiple rules that define the entities that are included. Rules are built upon matching entities and the powerful Dynatrace tagging engine.

Management zones are available as filters that are accessible via the menu bar

Management zone filters apply to all views that display multiple entities, such as dashboards, list pages (hosts, process groups, services, and applications), Smartscape, and the Technologies page.

## Instructions

1. Access Automatic tagging rules, select **Settings -> Preferences -> Management Zones**

2. Create management Zones for Production and Staging

Map your hosts into the correct zone using the **Service Tag** created in lab 2.

Apply to processes groups and hosts.
